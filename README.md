# Animal Kingdom

This exercise is about nesting of Flexbox container into each other.
As a bonus, override individual item alignments, to make animals fly or swim.

## content context - biology hierarchy
Animals are grouped by biologists into species, classes, families etc.

One common group are the mammals (they give birth to living descendants).
Other animals like birds, worms, reptiles lay eggs for example.

Another category is the animal's source of food.
Animals mostly eating plants are called herbivores (like herbal)
Animals mostly eating meat are called carnivores (chilli con carne ^_^)
Animals eating both regularly are called omnivores (omni - latin for all/much)

## example working environment
Imagine, that your company creates learning apps for children about this grouping.
A screen-designer already created designs, how the app should look like in the end.
A back-end developer who fills the markup with live, defined the structure of the HTML document.

Your task is, to get the planned layout working, by writing suitable CSS code.

The animal database is still in development: You only get one example from the back-end developer. Fill the markup with more example list-items to populate the page and test, if your layout works properly.

Do not change the structure of the HTML document itself (it's under control of other colleagues).

### non-biologist?

If searching for example data consumes too much time for you, here some tips:

Most big herbivores are mammals, like kettle, zebras, elephants, hippopotamus etc.
The most popular carnivores are wild cats like lions, cougars, tigers etc.
Some animals eat both, plants and meat, like racoons, most kind of bears etc. 
Most mammals live on land, few can fly like bats, and few are living in water like dolphins and whales.

Insects, reptiles, fish, birds do not belong to mammals, but also split into several food habits.
Most herbivores here are insects like bees, butterflies, or snails and slugs
Lots of insects, reptiles and amphibia are omnivores (ants, lizards, turtles)
Common non mammals with carnivorous food habits are bigger birds like eagles, penguins etc, but also small reptiles eating insects or smaller animals like frogs, snakes or similar.
